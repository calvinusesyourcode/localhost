# Hello world!

Nice to meet you. I am doing swell.

I wonder some days whether the void will swallow me

If everything breaks...

Nothing is sacred.

Pondering is the nature of our existence I'm afraid.

That's just the way it is!

Something will never change.

I guess it depends

Whether you think you're on top, sometimes it doesn't matter.

What seems to really matter is how much love you can radiate.

Love can win.

It doesn't matter how much they shit on you.

How much they try to slander it.
